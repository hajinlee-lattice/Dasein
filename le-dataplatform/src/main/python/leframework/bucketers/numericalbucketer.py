    """
Main function to get numeric buckets and associated metrics to write to avro in
data_profile.py
This is used for both data science internal and UI purposes.

For data science purpose, the buckets are more granular and there is no 
restriction on boundaries.
Example of the data science use case:
getBucketsAndStats(columnData, eventVector,  rawBinNumber = 200,
                       minPtsToBucket = 50, minSpecialValRatio = 0.02, minRegBucketSize = 20,

                       liftThreshold=1.8, fixBoundaries=False)

For UI use, there are upper and lower limits on number of buckets. It also uses
more 'round' boundaries. For most columns it means keeping 2 sigificant digits.
For employee count and revenue columns, when fixBoundaries is set to True, it 
uses some pre-defined boundaries.
Example of the UI use case:
fixbound = colName in ["BusinessEstimatedAnnualSales", "BusinessEstimatedEmployees"]
        bandsDictUI = getBucketsAndStats(columnData, eventVector,  rawBinNumber = 200,
                       minPtsToBucket = 50, minSpecialValRatio = 0.02, minRegBucketSize = 20,
                       sigThreshold = 8, minNumBuckets = 3, maxNumBuckets = 7, forUI = False,
                       kurtThreshold=3, numTailBuckets=2, tailSize=0.03, sizeThreshold=0.05, 
                       liftThreshold=1.8, fixBoundaries=fixbound)

columnData: input data, a numeric list
eventVector: a list of equivalent length compromising of only 1s and 0s
rawBinNumber: the number of small bins to create. These small bins are grouped
             together by the algorithm to form the eventual buckets.
minPtsToBucket: if there are less than this number of points, everything is put
               into a single bucket.
minSpecialValRatio: ratio threshold for a 'special value' to have its own bucket.
                Specifically, it's used for 1 in the current use case. NAs will
                always be in a separate bucket. 0s are always in a separate bucket
                when they are the minimum values. The special value status of 1
                in the UI use case is slightly more complicated -- it's only a 
                special value if threshold is met, and there are no possible buckets
                stranding 1.
minRegBucketSize: the smallest bucket size generated by the bucketing algorithm
                in normal circumstances.
sigThreshold: significance threshold to determine whether two adjacent bins are
               combined into the same bucket. For data science use case, if the
               threshold is met, combination will stop even if max number of buckets
               is exceeded. For UI use case, the max number of buckets specified 
               will always be adhered to.
minNumBuckets: the minimum number of buckets to generate in usual cases. This
               always takes precedence over sigThreshold. Exceptions where min
               buckets are ignored include: too few data, too few distinctive values,
               too few values with sufficient counts.
maxNumBuckets: the maximum number of buckets to generate in usual cases. In the
               UI use case this is always adhered to. In the data science use case,
               combination step stops once number of buckets is within maximum,
               but if sigThreshold is met, it could stop even when remaining 
               number of buckets is more than maximum.
forUI: boolean indicating whether it's for the UI use case
kurtThreshold: when kurtosis is above this threshold, the column is considered
               to have a fat tail, and the fat tail splitting function is called
numTailBuckets: number of buckets to split from the fat tail
tailSize: proportion of data points to put into the fat tail and split
sizeThreshold: lower threshold of low-lift buckets, when low-lift buckets are
               smaller than this, consider to combine them for UI use case.
               This is not applied to the fat tail split results.
liftThreshold: lower threshold of ratio of lifts between two neighboring buckets,
               when combining smaller buckets for UI. If one of them have size
               less than sizeThreshold and on one side the lift difference is 
               less than liftThreshold, merge the two buckets.
               This is not applied to the fat tail split results.
fixBoundaries: used fixed boundaries. This is introduced for employee and revenue
               columns which the customer often uses for segmentation.
