Apache Flink is a community-driven open source framework for distributed big data analytics, like Hadoop and Spark. The core of Apache Flink is a distributed streaming dataflow engine written in Java and Scala.[1][2] It aims to bridge the gap between MapReduce-like systems and shared-nothing parallel database systems. Therefore, Flink executes arbitrary dataflow programs in a data-parallel and pipelined manner.[3] Flink's pipelined runtime system enables the execution of bulk/batch and stream processing programs.[4][5] Furthermore, Flink's runtime supports the execution of iterative algorithms natively.[6]

Flink programs can be written in Java or Scala and are automatically compiled and optimized[7] into dataflow programs that are executed in a cluster or cloud environment.[8] Flink does not provide its own data storage system, input data must be stored in a distributed storage system like HDFS or HBase. For data stream processing, Flink consumes data from (reliable) message queues like Kafka.

Development[edit]
Apache Flink is developed under the Apache License 2.0[9] by the Apache Flink Community within the Apache Software Foundation. The project is driven by the Berlin-based start-up company dataArtisans, 20 committers, and more than 130 contributors.

Flink Forward[edit]
Flink Forward is a conference about Apache Flink. It took place for the first time on 12./13. October 2015 in Berlin. The conference featured 2 key notes, 32 talks from industry and academia, as well as practical training sessions on Flink. Flink Forward was repeated 2016 from 12-14 September in Berlin in extended form of 3 days, 43 speakers, and a Flink training similar to 2015.

History[edit]
In 2010, the research project "Stratosphere: Information Management on the Cloud"[10] (funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG)[11]) was started as a collaboration of Technical University Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Hasso-Plattner-Institut Potsdam. Flink is a Stratosphere fork and it became an Apache Incubator project in March 2014.[12] In December 2014, Flink was accepted as an Apache top-level project.[13][14][15][16]
