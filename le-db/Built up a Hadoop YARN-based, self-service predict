Built up a Hadoop YARN-based, self-service predictive analytics platform for the cloud with real-time PMML scoring.
Built up a data management suite of services for the cloud, from data import of JDBC data sources, Marketo, SFDC, Eloqua data to Cascading transformations and load back using Avro in HDFS.

Worked with architect, product to develop Lattice Predictive Insights, a Hadoop YARN-based, self-service predictive analytics platform for the cloud with real-time PMML scoring.

● Design and build up a file based scoring service using Hadoop Yarn and HDFS. The data stored in HDFS supports at-rest encryption.
● Build a provisioning tool for different services of the product using Zookeeper
● Technical lead on PlayMaker, salesPRISM, and Dante. I worked closely with product management to help refine
requirements for the entire team, worked and delivered on key backend features, and assisted and mentored
junior engineers when necessary.


1. how my contributions fit into larger scope (product): scoring
2. I can claim what I have learnt to what I know: admin console
3. One other thing I did not know but needs to know: cascading and Hadoop encryption.
