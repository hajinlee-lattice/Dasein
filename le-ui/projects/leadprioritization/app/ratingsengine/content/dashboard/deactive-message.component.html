<section class="rating-engine-deactivate">
    <p>Deactivating a model will prevent all of the plays which use it from launching. This model is currently being used by the following plays:</p>
    <ul class="plays-used-list">
        <li ng-repeat="play in vm.dashboard.plays">{{play.displayName}}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you choose to deactivate it, you can activate a different model to launch the play again.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, it's best practice to create a new play for a new model.</p>
